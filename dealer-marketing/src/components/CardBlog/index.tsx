      "Advertising has come a long way since its humble beginnings. There's no doubt about it â€“ marketing remains an ever-changing landscape: What worked a few years ago may not be effective today, and what's popular now may be out of style in a few months.

We'll explore what made them successful and see how they changed the marketing landscape forever.",
